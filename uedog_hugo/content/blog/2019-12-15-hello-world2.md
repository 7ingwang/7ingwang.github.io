One of the safest ways to transfer rights and interests for international workers is to transfer through multinational banks. However, the transmission process is cumbersome and long-term, and the loss of workers is relatively large, which is a huge loss to low-income migrant workers.

On the other hand, due to the limited coverage of the transmission media for the rights and interests of migran workers and the high share of transnational workers without card and account more international workers will not choose the formal banking system, but forced to find other ways, such as illegal banking, private banking and other illegal, high-risk, high-loss way.
